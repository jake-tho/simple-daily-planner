# simple-daily-planner
NOTE: John M and I went on vacation together over break and we worked on this homework together from our laptops while we are on vacation so if our code is very similar that is why.

First i made my schedueler by
    -Making an array where each item in the array is an object
    -each object holds all of the correct classification in order for it to play nicely with HTML and CSS syntax and organize each entrys information properly
I made the JS to generate all of the HTML for the planner and insert it into the document with features that automatically change the format of each of the hour blocks depending on the time of the day
I next wrote the JS to put the curent date in the header of the document
After i wrote the JS to add the save button to each of the rows
After adding the save button I wrote the JS to store all of the information of the entry to the Local Storage which will save all of teh information even if you close the browser and reopen it

This planner can help you keep track of your day and everything that you have to do for the day from meetings, assignments, projects, etc.
I am planning to further polish some of the visual aspects of this assignment in the future.
